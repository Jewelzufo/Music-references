## üéõÔ∏è Delay & Reverb Tips
- **Use Pre-Delay**: A **10-50ms pre-delay** helps **separate reverb from the dry signal**.
- **Sync Delay to Tempo**: Set delays to **1/4, 1/8, or 1/16 notes** for rhythmic precision.
- **Keep Low Frequencies Dry**: Avoid delay and reverb on **sub-bass and kicks** to prevent muddiness.
- **Experiment with Width**: **Stereo delay and ping-pong delay** can make sounds feel **wider**.
- **Use Reverb Sends**: Apply reverb **on a send channel** and EQ the **low-end out** for a cleaner mix.
