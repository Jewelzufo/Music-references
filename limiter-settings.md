# üéõÔ∏è Limiter Settings Guide

## Overview
A **limiter** is a specialized compressor designed to **prevent clipping**, **control peaks**, and **maximize loudness**. This table provides **recommended limiter settings** for different instruments and mastering.

## üî• Limiter Settings Table

| **Instrument / Use Case** | **Ceiling (dB)** | **Threshold (dB)** | **Attack (ms)** | **Release (ms)** | **Gain (Makeup dB)** | **Notes** |
|----------------|------------|--------------|------------|------------|------------|----------|
| **Vocals (Lead)** | -1 dB | -3 to -6 dB | 3-10 ms | 80-150 ms | Adjust for balance | Controls peaks and smooths loudness |
| **Vocals (Backing)** | -1 dB | -4 to -7 dB | 5-15 ms | 100-200 ms | Adjust for presence | Ensures backing vocals sit well in the mix |
| **Kick Drum** | -0.3 dB | -3 to -6 dB | 1-5 ms | 50-100 ms | Adjust to taste | Prevents over-peaking while keeping punch |
| **Snare Drum** | -0.3 dB | -4 to -8 dB | 1-5 ms | 60-120 ms | Minimal | Adds consistency while keeping transient impact |
| **Claps & Percussion** | -0.3 dB | -6 to -10 dB | 3-7 ms | 80-150 ms | Subtle | Controls sharp transients |
| **Hi-Hats** | -1 dB | -6 to -12 dB | 2-5 ms | 50-100 ms | Minimal | Smooths out harsh peaks without killing brightness |
| **Bass (Sub & Mid)** | -0.5 dB | -4 to -8 dB | 5-10 ms | 80-150 ms | Adjust for consistency | Ensures smooth, controlled low-end |
| **Synth Leads** | -0.3 dB | -3 to -6 dB | 5-15 ms | 100-200 ms | Moderate | Keeps lead synths powerful and balanced |
| **Pads** | -1 dB | -6 to -10 dB | 10-30 ms | 150-300 ms | Subtle | Prevents over-peaks while keeping dynamics |
| **Plucks** | -0.5 dB | -4 to -8 dB | 3-10 ms | 80-150 ms | Subtle | Ensures clarity and balance |
| **FX (Risers & Impacts)** | -0.5 dB | -6 to -12 dB | 5-15 ms | 200-500 ms | Moderate | Keeps effects loud but under control |
| **Guitar (Electric & Acoustic)** | -0.5 dB | -6 to -10 dB | 10-20 ms | 100-200 ms | Adjust for presence | Ensures smooth sustain and no harsh peaks |
| **Piano & Keys** | -0.5 dB | -6 to -10 dB | 10-30 ms | 150-300 ms | Subtle | Controls dynamics for even performance |
| **Drum Buss** | -0.3 dB | -3 to -6 dB | 5-10 ms | 80-150 ms | Slight boost | Adds punch while preventing peaks |
| **Master Buss (Mix Limiting)** | -0.3 dB | -3 to -6 dB | 20-40 ms | 100-300 ms | Slight boost | Gently controls peaks to prevent clipping |
| **Mastering (Final Limiting)** | -0.1 dB | -6 to -9 dB | 20-50 ms | 200-500 ms | Adjust for loudness | Maximizes perceived loudness while keeping dynamics intact |

## üéõÔ∏è Limiting Tips
- **Set the Ceiling Correctly**: **Mastering limiters** should be set between **-0.3 dB to -0.1 dB** to prevent inter-sample clipping.
- **Use Fast Attack for Percussion**: A **1-5 ms attack** works best for **kicks, snares, and percussion** to retain punch.
- **Use Slower Release for Natural Sound**: **Longer release times** (100-300 ms) prevent distortion and pumping effects.
- **Avoid Over-Limiting**: Too much limiting can result in **loss of dynamics** and **distortion**‚Äîalways **compare with bypassed signal**.
- **Check LUFS for Mastering**: Aim for **-14 LUFS for streaming** and **-8 to -10 LUFS for loud EDM/club tracks**.
