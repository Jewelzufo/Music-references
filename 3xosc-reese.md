# üéõÔ∏è 3xOSC Deep Reese Bass Sound Design

## Overview
A **Reese Bass** is a rich, detuned bass sound commonly used in **Wave, DnB, Dubstep, and Ambient Trap**. This table provides **various settings** in **FL Studio's 3xOSC** to design a deep Reese bass.

## üî• 3xOSC Reese Bass Settings

| **Parameter**       | **Recommended Settings** | **Alternative Settings** | **Notes** |
|---------------------|------------------------|------------------------|-----------|
| **OSC 1 Waveform** | Saw | Square | Saw gives a classic Reese texture, Square adds more depth |
| **OSC 2 Waveform** | Saw | Sine | Slight detune against OSC 1 to create movement |
| **OSC 3 Waveform** | Saw | Triangle | Blends harmonics for a fuller sound |
| **Detune (OSC 2 & 3)** | 15-30% | 40-50% for extreme wobble | Increases stereo width and phasing effect |
| **Stereo Phase Offset** | 20-50% | 0% (mono) | Higher values add width, lower values keep it centered |
| **Panning (OSC 2 & 3)** | Slight L/R spread | Hard L/R for wide sound | Subtle panning creates more stereo depth |
| **Filter Type** | Low-Pass | Band-Pass | Low-pass keeps bass deep, band-pass creates a mid-range Reese |
| **Filter Cutoff** | 100-250 Hz | 300-500 Hz | Higher values make it more midrange-heavy |
| **Filter Resonance** | 10-20% | 30-40% for a sharper tone | Too much resonance can create unwanted peaks |
| **LFO Modulation** | Slow, 0.1-0.5 Hz | 1-2 Hz for fast movement | Affects filter cutoff or pitch for movement |
| **LFO Target** | Filter Cutoff | Volume | Filter modulation creates a classic Reese wobble |
| **LFO Shape** | Triangle | Sine | Triangle is smoother, sine gives gradual movement |
| **Attack (Envelope)** | 0ms | 50ms for soft attack | Determines how quickly the sound reaches full volume |
| **Decay (Envelope)** | 300ms - 1s | 1.5s for longer fades | Longer decay creates a drawn-out bass |
| **Sustain (Envelope)** | 100% | 50-80% | Full sustain keeps the bass steady |
| **Release (Envelope)** | 200-500ms | 1s for a softer fade | Long release helps smooth out transitions |
| **Distortion (Fruity Blood Overdrive)** | 20-50% | 60-80% for aggressive tone | Adds grit and presence |
| **Chorus (Fruity Chorus)** | Depth: 50%, Rate: Slow | Depth: 80%, Rate: Medium | Thickens the sound with subtle movement |
| **Phaser (Fruity Phaser)** | Depth: 30%, Rate: 0.2 Hz | Depth: 50%, Rate: 0.5 Hz | Creates additional stereo wobble |
| **Reverb (Fruity Reeverb 2)** | Small Room, 20% Wet | Large Hall, 50% Wet | Light reverb adds space without muddying bass |
| **EQ (Fruity Parametric EQ 2)** | Boost 100-250 Hz | Boost 500-1kHz for mids | Balances the presence of the bass |
| **Sidechain (Fruity Limiter/Peak Controller)** | Moderate (Kick sidechain) | Heavy (duck completely under kick) | Essential for mixing in Wave music |

## üéõÔ∏è Sound Design Tips
- **Use Detune & Phaser**: A Reese bass gets its character from detuned oscillators and stereo movement.
- **Try Different Waveforms**: While saw waves are standard, mixing in **triangle or sine** adds warmth.
- **Add Sub-Layer**: Layer a separate **pure sine wave sub** under the Reese bass for extra low-end.
- **Experiment with LFOs**: Slow modulation on the **filter cutoff** gives a **flowing, atmospheric effect**.
- **Use Post-Processing**: A Reese bass often benefits from **chorus, phaser, EQ, and slight distortion**.
