## ⚡ Pro Tips for Compression in EDM
- **Shorter attack times** make transients sharper, while **longer attack times** let transients breathe.
- **Faster release times** add energy and bounce; **slower releases** smooth out the dynamics.
- Use **parallel compression** on drums and vocals for extra punch without killing dynamics.
- Keep **sidechain compression** in mind for EDM bass and kick interaction.
