## 🔥 Common Sidechain Compression Settings

| **Sidechain Type** | **Trigger Source** | **Target Sound** | **Ratio** | **Threshold (dB)** | **Attack (ms)** | **Release (ms)** | **Mix Level (%)** | **Notes** |
|----------------|----------------|----------------|---------|--------------|------------|------------|------------|----------|
| **Classic EDM Pumping** | Kick Drum | Bass | 4:1 – 6:1 | -6 to -12 dB | 1-5 ms | 100-300 ms | 100% | Creates rhythmic movement |
| **Subtle Groove** | Kick Drum | Pads/Synths | 2:1 – 4:1 | -3 to -6 dB | 5-10 ms | 200-400 ms | 50-70% | Helps pads blend smoothly |
| **Aggressive Pumping** | Kick Drum | Everything (except drums) | 6:1 – 10:1 | -10 to -15 dB | 1-3 ms | 150-300 ms | 100% | Used in big-room EDM & festival tracks |
| **Vocal Clarity** | Lead Vocals | Backing Vocals or Reverb | 2:1 – 3:1 | -3 to -8 dB | 10-20 ms | 150-250 ms | 50-70% | Keeps lead vocals clear in a busy mix |
| **Bass/Kick Ducking** | Kick Drum | Sub-Bass | 4:1 – 8:1 | -6 to -12 dB | 2-5 ms | 100-250 ms | 100% | Ensures the bass and kick don’t clash |
| **Snare Reverb Control** | Snare | Snare Reverb | 3:1 – 5:1 | -4 to -8 dB | 5-15 ms | 200-500 ms | 50-80% | Prevents excessive snare reverb tail |
| **Hi-Hat Transparency** | Kick Drum | Hi-Hats | 2:1 – 4:1 | -3 to -6 dB | 5-10 ms | 100-200 ms | 40-60% | Helps hi-hats stay clean in the mix |
| **Reverb Ducking** | Vocals | Vocal Reverb | 2:1 – 3:1 | -3 to -6 dB | 10-30 ms | 300-600 ms | 50-70% | Keeps reverb under control while vocals are active |
| **FX Ducking** | Kick Drum | Risers & FX | 3:1 – 6:1 | -6 to -12 dB | 1-5 ms | 200-400 ms | 100% | Ensures risers don’t clash with the drop |
| **Master Buss Sidechain** | Kick Drum | Full Mix | 2:1 – 4:1 | -3 to -6 dB | 5-15 ms | 150-300 ms | 50-80% | Light sidechain to glue mix together |

## 🎛️ Sidechain Compression Tips
- **Use a Fast Attack** (1-5 ms) for tight and instant ducking.
- **Longer Release = Smoother Pumping**, while **short Release = Snappy Effect**.
- **Blend the Sidechain Effect** by adjusting the **Mix Level** if using parallel sidechain compression.
- **For Transparent Sidechain**, use a **lower ratio (2:1 – 4:1) and slower release**.
- **For Extreme Sidechain**, increase the ratio and threshold **for heavy pumping effects**.
