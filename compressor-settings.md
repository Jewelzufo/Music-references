## 🔥 Standard Compressor Settings

| **Instrument**  | **Ratio**  | **Threshold** | **Attack**  | **Release** | **Knee** | **Gain (Makeup)** | **Notes** |
|----------------|------------|--------------|------------|------------|-----------|------------------|----------|
| **Kick Drum**  | 4:1 – 6:1   | -6 dB to -12 dB | 5-10 ms  | 50-100 ms  | Soft | Adjust to match original loudness | Enhances punch and consistency |
| **Snare Drum** | 4:1 – 7:1   | -10 dB to -15 dB | 3-10 ms  | 50-150 ms  | Hard | Adjust for presence | Adds body and sustain |
| **Claps**     | 3:1 – 5:1   | -8 dB to -12 dB | 5-15 ms  | 100-200 ms | Soft | Slight boost | Controls dynamics and adds snap |
| **Hi-Hats**   | 2:1 – 3:1   | -6 dB to -10 dB | 2-5 ms   | 20-50 ms  | Soft | Minimal | Smooths out sharp transients |
| **Percussion** | 3:1 – 5:1   | -8 dB to -12 dB | 5-10 ms  | 80-150 ms | Medium | Moderate | Tightens percussive elements |
| **Bass (Sub & Mid)** | 4:1 – 6:1 | -8 dB to -12 dB | 10-30 ms | 80-150 ms | Medium | Adjust to taste | Adds stability and sustain |
| **Synth Leads** | 3:1 – 5:1   | -8 dB to -12 dB | 5-15 ms  | 100-200 ms | Soft | Moderate | Controls peaks and smooths dynamics |
| **Pads**       | 2:1 – 4:1   | -6 dB to -10 dB | 10-30 ms | 150-300 ms | Soft | Subtle | Keeps pads even without pumping |
| **Plucks**     | 3:1 – 5:1   | -8 dB to -12 dB | 5-15 ms  | 100-250 ms | Soft | Adjust for presence | Retains attack while smoothing sustain |
| **FX (Risers & Impacts)** | 2:1 – 4:1 | -6 dB to -10 dB | 10-30 ms | 200-500 ms | Soft | Moderate | Adds consistency to long FX tails |
| **Vocals (Lead & Backing)** | 3:1 – 6:1 | -8 dB to -15 dB | 5-15 ms | 80-200 ms | Medium | Adjust for clarity | Maintains vocal presence and balance |
| **Guitar (Acoustic & Electric)** | 3:1 – 5:1 | -6 dB to -12 dB | 10-20 ms | 80-200 ms | Soft | Adjust to taste | Controls dynamics and smooths performance |
| **Piano & Keys** | 3:1 – 4:1 | -6 dB to -10 dB | 10-30 ms | 150-300 ms | Soft | Subtle | Evens out dynamics for natural feel |
| **Master Buss** | 2:1 – 4:1   | -3 dB to -6 dB | 20-40 ms | 100-300 ms | Soft | Slight boost | Glues the mix together |

## 🎛️ Compression Tips
- **Shorter attack times** make transients sharper, while **longer attack times** let transients breathe.
- **Faster release times** add energy and bounce; **slower releases** smooth out the dynamics.
- Use **parallel compression** on drums and vocals for extra punch without killing dynamics.
- Keep **sidechain compression** in mind for EDM bass and kick interaction.
- **Use a soft knee for smoother compression** and a **hard knee for more aggressive compression**.
