# Common EQ Mixing Tips

This table provides **essential EQ mixing tips** for different instruments, helping to shape their tone and avoid frequency clashes in a mix.

| Frequency Range | Instrument | EQ Tip |
|----------------|------------|--------|
| **20-60 Hz (Sub-Bass)** | Kick Drum, Bass | Boost for deep sub-bass, cut to reduce rumble; avoid excessive boosting to prevent muddiness. |
| **60-150 Hz (Bass Body)** | Bass Guitar, Kick Drum | Boost for warmth and fullness; cut if mix is too boomy. |
| **150-400 Hz (Low Mids)** | Guitars, Vocals, Snare | Boost for warmth; cut to reduce muddiness, especially on multiple instruments. |
| **400-800 Hz (Muddy Range)** | Vocals, Guitar, Piano | Cut in this range to clean up boxy or muddy sounds. |
| **800 Hz - 2 kHz (Presence & Attack)** | Snare, Guitar, Vocals | Boost to enhance attack and presence; cut if harsh. |
| **2-5 kHz (Clarity & Definition)** | Vocals, Guitar, Hi-Hats | Boost for intelligibility and clarity; cut to reduce sharpness. |
| **5-10 kHz (Air & Sparkle)** | Cymbals, Vocals, Synths | Boost for brightness and shimmer; cut if too harsh or sibilant. |
| **10-20 kHz (Ultra Highs)** | Cymbals, Vocals, Air FX | Boost for a sense of openness; cut to remove hiss and excessive brightness. |

### Additional EQ Tips:
- **Cut Before Boosting**: Start by removing problem frequencies before boosting.
- **Use a High-Pass Filter**: Remove unnecessary low-end frequencies from non-bass instruments.
- **Avoid Frequency Clashes**: Make room for each instrument by cutting frequencies in competing sounds.
- **Boost with a Wide Q, Cut with a Narrow Q**: Broad boosts sound more natural, while narrow cuts are effective for removing problem frequencies.

These tips provide a **solid foundation for EQ mixing**, helping to create **clear, balanced, and professional-sounding** mixes.
