# üéöÔ∏è EDM Kick, Bass, and Sub Bass Mixing Guide

## Overview
Achieving a **tight, powerful low-end** is crucial in EDM. This chart provides recommended mixing settings for **Kick, Bass, and Sub Bass**, focusing on **EQ, Compression, Sidechain, and Stereo Width** to ensure clarity and punch.

## üî• Mixing Settings Chart

| **Element** | **EQ Settings** | **Compression** | **Sidechain** | **Stereo Width** | **Additional Notes** |
|------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|----------------|
| **Kick Drum** | Low-cut below **30 Hz** to remove mud, small boost at **50-100 Hz** for punch, cut **300-600 Hz** to reduce boxiness | Ratio: **4:1 ‚Äì 6:1**, Attack: **5-10 ms**, Release: **50-100 ms**, Threshold: **-6 dB to -12 dB** | Moderate sidechain trigger for **Bass & Sub Bass** | Keep **Mono** for a centered low-end | Ensure the kick is **short and punchy** to avoid clashing with bass |
| **Sub Bass** | Low-pass at **100 Hz**, cut **30-50 Hz** to remove rumble, avoid midrange boosts | Ratio: **3:1 ‚Äì 5:1**, Attack: **10-30 ms**, Release: **80-150 ms**, Threshold: **-8 dB to -12 dB** | **Strong sidechain** from the Kick to create space | Keep **Mono** for a solid foundation | Use **sine waves or low harmonic content** for cleaner subs |
| **Bass (Mid & High)** | High-pass at **40-50 Hz**, boost **100-200 Hz** for warmth, cut **300-500 Hz** to reduce muddiness, boost **1-3 kHz** for presence | Ratio: **3:1 ‚Äì 5:1**, Attack: **10-20 ms**, Release: **80-150 ms**, Threshold: **-8 dB to -12 dB** | **Moderate sidechain** from the Kick (less than Sub Bass) | **Slightly wider** in stereo (avoid excessive widening) | Layer with **higher harmonics** to cut through on small speakers |

## üéõÔ∏è Additional Tips for a Clean Low-End
- **Use an Analyzer**: Check **low-end phase issues** to prevent phase cancellation.
- **Balance Kick & Bass Levels**: The kick should be slightly louder in peak levels, but bass should carry the energy.
- **Use Distortion/Saturation on Bass**: Adds harmonics to help bass be heard on small speakers.
- **Avoid Too Much Reverb on Low Frequencies**: Use a **high-pass filter** on reverb to prevent muddiness.
- **Test in Mono**: Ensure the low-end still sounds powerful when summed to mono.
