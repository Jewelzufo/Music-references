# üéõÔ∏è Sound Design Combination Guide

## Overview
Understanding **sound layering and synthesis** is essential for designing unique EDM sounds. This table outlines **basic sounds**, their **characteristics**, and what happens when they are **combined**.

## üî• Sound Combination Chart

| **Basic Sound**     | **Characteristics** | **Combined With** | **Resulting Sound** |
|--------------------|-------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Sine Wave**      | Pure tone, deep, warm | Square wave | Adds warmth and sub-bass depth |
| **Square Wave**    | Hollow, rich, buzzy | Saw wave | Fuller, aggressive tone (great for leads) |
| **Saw Wave**       | Bright, sharp, rich in harmonics | Noise | Gritty, textured synth (used in supersaws) |
| **Triangle Wave**  | Soft, slightly hollow | Sine wave | Smooth and mellow bass or pad sound |
| **White Noise**    | Hiss, broadband sound | Any waveform | Adds texture and attack (hi-hats, impacts) |
| **Pulse Wave**     | Thin, reedy, unique harmonics | Detuned pulse | Phaser-like, evolving tone (good for pads) |
| **FM Modulation**  | Metallic, bell-like, digital | Sine wave | Digital plucks, metallic textures |
| **AM Modulation**  | Harsh, robotic, distorted | Square wave | Industrial, gritty, robotic sounds |
| **Super Saw (Detuned Saw Waves)** | Wide, lush, rich | Reverb + Chorus | Huge trance leads and pads |
| **Resonant Filter Sweep** | Whistling, vowel-like movement | Saw wave | Wobbly synth (great for risers and growls) |
| **Formant Filters** | Vocal-like, vowel shaping | Noise | Robotic voices and talking bass sounds |
| **Granular Synthesis** | Chopped, glitchy, time-stretched | Pads & Atmosphere | Ambient textures, futuristic soundscapes |

## üéõÔ∏è Sound Design Tips
- **Layering different waveforms** adds **richness and depth** to the sound.
- **Filtering and modulation** create **movement** and make static sounds more interesting.
- **White noise layering** can add **clarity and energy** to synths and percussions.
- **FM/AM modulation** is useful for **metallic and robotic tones**.
- **Effects like reverb, chorus, and phasers** enhance depth and width.
