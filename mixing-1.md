# EDM Mixing Reference Chart

## Purpose

This document serves as a quick reference guide for mixing down Electronic Dance Music (EDM) tracks. It provides suggested starting points for relative volume levels (dB), common and necessary effects, and typical frequency ranges to remove with EQ to achieve a clear and balanced mix.

## How to Use

This chart is intended as a guideline and a starting point. Remember that mixing is a creative process, and the specific needs of your track will always take precedence.

1.  **Relative Levels:** The "Suggested dB Level" column indicates the approximate volume of each instrument relative to the kick drum (set at 0 dB). Adjust these levels based on your artistic vision and the specific sounds you are using.
2.  **Necessary FX:** This column lists common and often essential effects used on each instrument in EDM. Experiment with these to shape the sound and create the desired character.
3.  **Frequencies to Remove (EQ):** This column suggests frequency ranges that are often cut or attenuated with an equalizer (EQ) to prevent muddiness, clashing, and achieve a cleaner mix. Be cautious and use your ears to determine the appropriate cuts.
4.  **Mixing Notes:** This column provides additional context and tips for mixing each specific instrument within an EDM context.

**Always trust your ears and listen critically on various playback systems!**

## Mixing Reference Table

| Instrument         | Suggested dB Level (Relative to Kick) | Necessary FX                  | Frequencies to Remove (EQ)                                                                 | Mixing Notes                                                                                                |
| :----------------- | :-------------------------------------: | :----------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Kick Drum** |                  0 dB                   | Compression, Limiting (subtle) | Sub-bass frequencies of other instruments (below ~50Hz if not needed for kick), muddy low-mids (~200-500Hz if boxy) | The foundation of your track's energy. Ensure it's punchy and sits well in the low-end.                     |
| **Snare/Clap** |               -6 to -3 dB               | Reverb, Compression, Transient Shaping | Low-mids (~200-400Hz if too thick), very low frequencies (below ~80Hz), harsh high-mids (~2-4kHz if piercing) | Provides the rhythmic backbone alongside the kick. Can be layered for more impact.                         |
| **Hi-Hats (Closed)** |               -12 to -9 dB              | High-Pass Filter, (Optional) Delay | Low frequencies (below ~300Hz), resonant frequencies causing ringing                         | Adds rhythmic detail and movement. Ensure they don't clutter the low-mid range.                               |
| **Hi-Hats (Open)** |              -15 to -10 dB              | High-Pass Filter, Reverb (short) | Low frequencies (below ~300Hz)                                                              | Used for emphasis and fills. Should be less prominent than closed hats.                                     |
| **Cymbals/Rides** |              -18 to -12 dB              | High-Pass Filter, Reverb       | Low frequencies (below ~500Hz), harsh high frequencies                                      | Adds texture and atmosphere. Can easily become overwhelming if too loud.                                    |
| **Sub Bass** |               -3 to +3 dB               | Compression, Limiting (subtle), (Optional) Subharmonic Synthesis | Frequencies above ~150-200Hz (use a low-pass filter to keep it clean), muddy low-mids if present | Provides the deep low-end. Often mono below a certain frequency (e.g., 100-150Hz).                       |
| **Mid Bass** |               -10 to -4 dB               | Distortion, Compression, Filter Modulation | Frequencies below ~80-100Hz (to avoid clashing with sub), muddy low-mids, harsh high frequencies | Adds energy and movement in the mid-low frequencies. Can be a synth bass, growl, or other textured bass. |
| **Lead Synth** |               -8 to -2 dB               | Reverb, Delay, Chorus/Unison, Distortion, Compression | Low frequencies (below ~200-300Hz), frequencies clashing with vocals or other melodic elements | Often the most prominent melodic element. Needs to cut through the mix.                                    |
| **Pad Synth** |              -14 to -6 dB               | Reverb (lush), Delay, Chorus/Unison, High-Pass Filter | Low frequencies (below ~200-300Hz), muddy mid-frequencies, resonant peaks                 | Creates atmosphere and harmonic foundation. Should sit behind the lead and bass.                             |
| **Pluck Synth** |              -12 to -6 dB               | Reverb (short), Delay (short), Chorus | Low frequencies (below ~200-300Hz), resonant frequencies causing harshness                 | Used for rhythmic melodies and arpeggios. Can add percussive elements to the track.                        |
| **Vocals (Lead)** |              -10 to -4 dB               | Compression, EQ, Reverb, Delay, Chorus | Low frequencies (below ~100-150Hz), muddy low-mids, harsh high frequencies (sibilance)      | Should be clear and sit prominently in the mix. Requires careful EQ and processing.                       |
| **Vocals (Backing)** |             -18 to -10 dB              | Compression, EQ, Reverb, Delay, Chorus | Low frequencies (below ~150-200Hz), frequencies clashing with the lead vocal             | Adds depth and harmony without overpowering the main vocal.                                                |
| **FX (Sweeps, Risers)** |           Varies (Automated)          | Reverb, Delay, Pitch Shifting, Filtering | Frequencies depending on the specific sound – often broad sweeps covering many frequencies | Used for transitions and building tension. Levels should be automated for impact.                         |
| **FX (Impacts, Downlifters)** |         Varies (Often louder)      | Reverb, Delay, Compression       | Frequencies depending on the specific sound – often broad spectrum sounds                 | Used for emphasizing key moments and creating dynamic shifts.                                              |
